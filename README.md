WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe

## Challenges

I encountered a number of challenges while working on this assignment. I was able to get user input and display current weather. I struggled with keeping a list of the cities searched on the left  hand tab and getting all of the 5 day forecast icons to appear.
